Now that you are inspired by your ability to debug the countAT-bugs code, let's create a new program that will ask the user to enter a DNA sequence and then output the total sequence length and the number of each base {total As, Cs, Gs, Ts} found in the sequence. For example, given the string:

AAAATGAATGGCTAACTTTTGAA

the program should output:

Your sequence is 23 nucleotides long with the following breakdown of bases:

number As = 10 number Cs = 2 number Gs = 4 number Ts = 7
